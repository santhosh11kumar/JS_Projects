                    Kakashi Hatake (はたけカカシ, Hatake Kakashi) is a shinobi of
                    Konohagakure's Hatake clan. Famed as Kakashi of the
                    Sharingan
                    (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi), copy cat ninja. he is one
                    of Konoha's most
                    talented ninja, regularly looked to for advice and
                    leadership
                    despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his
                    students
                    on Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he
                    himself received this lesson, along with the Sharingan, from
                    his
                    childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi
                    World
                    War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage (六代目火影, Rokudaime
                    Hokage, literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).</div>

                    Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of
                    Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinchūriki of the
                    Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him
                    to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood.
                    After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the
                    village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to
                    become Hokage. In the following years, through many
                    hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded
                    as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of
                    the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf
                    (木ノ葉隠れの英雄, Konohagakure no Eiyū, literally meaning: Hero of
                    the Hidden Tree Leaves). He soon proved to be one of the
                    main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War,
                    leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's
                    Seventh Hokage (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, literally meaning:
                    Seventh Fire Shadow).</div>

                    Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary
                    leader of the Uchiha Clan. He founded Konohagakure alongside
                    his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju, with the
                    intention of bringing about an era of peace. When the two
                    couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for
                    control of the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's
                    death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into
                    hiding to work on his own plans. Unable to complete it in
                    his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to
                    Obito shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara
                    would be revived, only to see his plans foiled and
                    ultimately, and finally, realising the error of his ways and
                    making amends with Hashirama before his final death.

                    Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of
                    Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He
                    later became an international criminal after murdering his
                    entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He
                    afterwards joined the international criminal organisation
                    known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent
                    conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who
                    sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his
                    death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated
                    than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the
                    interest of his brother and village, making him remain a
                    loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.</div>

                    surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. After his
                    older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made
                    it his mission in life to avenge them by killing Itachi. He
                    is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through
                    competition with his rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki,
                    Sasuke starts developing his skills, but eventually grows
                    dissatisfied with his progress. He defects from Konoha so
                    that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge
                    and master the Cursed Seal of Heaven. His years of seeking
                    vengeance and his actions that followed become increasingly
                    demanding, irrational and isolates him from others, leading
                    him to be branded as an international criminal. After
